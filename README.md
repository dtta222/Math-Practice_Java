# This program can be used as a math tutor for a young student. It repeatedly allows the user to practice solving Multiplication questions until the user inputs "q" to stop. When the practice for the user stops, this program generates the report:
# (1) the list of questions with correct answers which the user has practiced;
# (2) the total number of questions the user has solved;
# (3) the total number of mistakes the user has made;
# (4) display either "Great job!"(if (2) > (3)) or "You will do better next time..." (otherwise) it then quits the program.
